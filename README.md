## What next

Now that the competition is over I want to consolidate my learnings in a set of
techniques and technologies. Ultimately I want this to become a review of what
we did and a getting started point on the next data based hackathon. I will
update [ANALYSIS_OVERVIEW.md](./ANALYSIS_OVERVIEW.md)
