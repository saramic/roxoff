# RoxOff

Rox on, Rox off - the Adaptive Driver Performance Training for bogger drivers
in Newcrest Cadia mines. A repo of our analysis of Bogger (loader) data and how
to improve efficiency.

Now that the competition is over I want to consolidate my learnings in a set of
techniques and technologies. Ultimately I want this to become a review of what
we did and a getting started point on the next data based hackathon.

## Prelim Analysis

The logical way to get to know the data both as the real analysis and demo of
the techniques used in the analysis using [Jupyter
notebooks](http://jupyter.org/)

## Techniques
